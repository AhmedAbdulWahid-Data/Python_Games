## 🌟 Overview
This is a **Pac-Man** game built from scratch using Python and the **Pygame** library! The objective? Navigate the maze, gobble up all the dots, and avoid the ghosts at all costs! 🏃‍♂️👻

As a data scientist and game dev enthusiast, this project shows off my ability to:
- Code in **Python** 🐍
- Create interactive **games** with **Pygame** 🎮
- Apply logic to create game mechanics (like ghost AI) 🤖
- Manage **animations** and **collision detection** for a seamless experience ✨

## 🏅 Key Features
- **Smooth Pac-Man animations**: Watch Pac-Man's mouth open and close as it chows down on those dots! 🟡👄
- **Ghost AI**: The ghosts aren't just random; they’ve got a mind of their own! 🧠👻
- **Scoring**: For every dot eaten, your score goes up! The race to beat your high score is on! 🏆
- **Game-over Screen**: When you meet the ghosts, the game’s over. But don’t worry, you can restart! 🔄
